- **Power Query**: Data type identification and transformation.
- **Data Analysis Toolpak (Excel Add-In)**: Correlation analysis & descriptive statistics.

### Techniques:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Used for analyzing central tendencies (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation).
- **Visualization**: Clustered bar charts, pie charts, and other visual aids to highlight patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables like age, investment duration, and return expectations.
